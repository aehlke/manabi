progress bars like smart.fm. but label the bar as "Memory strength", and don't have it out of 100%,
but instead as a categorized meter, like terror alert levels.

then when we have that, show a few of the decks which need attention on the home page, under the 'study now' button
in a list like smart.fm, with their bars on each


achievements like lingt.com



Sparklines
-----------
light gray background progress bar to show % started
dark gray inner bar to show... % mid-interval (i.e. started but not yet due)?
colorize the inner bar somehow - segmented by grade?

cell with # due in fg. bg color darkness is severity -- % of deck which is due? or how badly overdue maybe? (amount overdue : interval ratio ???)

colored cell:
hue shows memory strength
saturation or brightness shows % overdue? or amount over due in relation to intervals or something
