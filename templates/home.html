<h1>Welcome</h1>

<strong>Japanese 497B Students:</strong><br>
Thanks for joining my site. I hope that it will help you learn vocab and kanji from your class and, 
more importantly, retain your memory of what you've already learned.<br>
<br>
To get started, click the 'Decks' button and then the 'Download shared decks' link. I've already created 
and shared decks for your textbook, so you can download them there by clicking 'Download' for each chapter. Then you 
can start reviewing the flashcards by clicking the 'Start Reviewing' button. When a flashcard is displayed, 
try to think of the answer, and click the 'Show Answer' button to see it. Then rate yourself for how well you 
recalled the answer by selecting one of the grade buttons. See the explanation below for what each review grade 
means.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What the flashcard review grades mean:</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li><em>Wrong</em> - Rate a card as this if you couldn't remember its answer, or if you remembered it incorrectly or made a mistake.</li>
    <li><em>Hard</em> - This grade means that you remembered the card's answer, but it was difficult to recall and took too long. This tells the flashcard algorithm that you should have reviewed this card earlier than you did.</li>
    <li><em>Good</em> - This means that you recalled the card's answer correctly and with just a small amount of difficulty. This is the ideal response and means that this software is working effectively.</li>
    <li><em>Too Easy</em> - This means that you recalled the answer very easily. You could have waited a while longer to review this card - it wasn't necessary to review it this early.</li>
</ul>
<br>
This flashcard software uses the grades that you give each card to determine when you should review that card next in the future. When you're just starting to learn a new card, it's okay (and expected) that you'll have to rate the card review as a failure (the <em>Wrong</em> grade). After this initial learning period, ideally most of your grades will be <em>Good</em>. Please grade your cards honestly, and don't be afraid to give it a low rating if you're unsure of yourself.
<br>
<br>
{% comment %}<em>Hint:</em> You can press 1-4 on your keyboard to grade cards instead of clicking the buttons (1=wrong, 2=hard, 3=good, 4=too easy). You can also show the flashcard answer by pressing the spacebar.

Sorry for the rudimentary user interface - it's just temporary. I'm focusing on functionality before I work on better usability.
