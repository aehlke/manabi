<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please <a href="mailto:support@manabi.org">contact us</a>.
</p><p>
It is Manabi's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Manabi collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Manabi's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Manabi's visitors use its website. From time to time, Manabi may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
</p><p>
Manabi also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on flashcard decks. Manabi only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Manabi's websites choose to interact with Manabi in ways that require Manabi to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Manabi gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Manabi.org to provide a username and email address. In each case, Manabi collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Manabi. Manabi does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Manabi may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Manabi may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Manabi does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Manabi discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Manabi's behalf or to provide services available at Manabi's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Manabi's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Manabi will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Manabi discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Manabi believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Manabi, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Manabi website and have supplied your email address, Manabi may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Manabi and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Manabi takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Manabi uses cookies to help Manabi identify and track visitors, their usage of Manabi website, and their website access preferences. Manabi visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Manabi's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Manabi's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Manabi may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Manabi's sole discretion. Manabi encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
