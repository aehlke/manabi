                        Rate this card wrong if you:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Couldn't remember the answer</li>
                            <li>Remembered an incorrect answer</li>
                            <li>Remembered, but made a mistake</li>
                        </ul>
                        Also, to avoid the "Tip of the Tongue" syndrome,<br>
                        rate a card wrong if the answer is taking too<br>
                        long to come to you.

                    This grade means that you remembered the<br>
                    card's answer, but it was difficult and took too<br>
                    long to recall.<br>

                    It tells the flashcard algorithm that you<br>

                    than you did.

                    You could have waited a while longer<br>
