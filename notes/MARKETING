Why Manabi?
    <p>Manabi uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank" class="definition">spaced repetition</a> algorithm to remind you when and what you need to review, by tracking your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve" target="_blank" class="definition">forgetting curve</a> for every card you study. We know when to remind you just before you're about to forget something - the best time for review.</p>
    <p>In short, it's less work and less worry for you to retain what you learn. It's easy, and free.</p>
