2014 Reboot Ideas
-----------------
Limit to N new cards per day before asking confirmation to continue learning new cards.
But don't count new cards that were judged correctly on first review against the daily limit.
This should maybe only apply to shared decks, because it's less a signifier that the user already knows the card
if their first review is right after they manually created the card. That's if anything a signifier of it
actually being new to them.



New Ideas
---------

progress bars like smart.fm. but label the bar as "Memory strength", and don't have it out of 100%,
but instead as a categorized meter, like terror alert levels.

then when we have that, show a few of the decks which need attention on the home page, under the 'study now' button
in a list like smart.fm, with their bars on each


achievements like lingt.com



Sparklines
-----------
light gray background progress bar to show % started
dark gray inner bar to show... % mid-interval (i.e. started but not yet due)?
colorize the inner bar somehow - segmented by grade?

cell with # due in fg. bg color darkness is severity -- % of deck which is due? or how badly overdue maybe? (amount overdue : interval ratio ???)

colored cell:
hue shows memory strength
saturation or brightness shows % overdue? or amount over due in relation to intervals or something




random ideas
------------
stats like most missed words for all users

reading level algo
-----------------
For Japanese, the critical factors are: sentence length, length of runs of Roman letters and symbols and of the different Japanese characters (Hiragana, Kanji and Katakana), and the ratio of tooten(comma) to kuten(period). The original formula used 10 factors, the following is only based off of six.

Readability Score = -(0.12 * LS) - (1.37 * LA) + (7.4 * LH) - (23.18 * LC) - (5.4 * LK) - (4.67 * CP) + 115.79

LS = length of the sentences
LA = average number of Roman letters and symbols per run
LH = average number of Hiragana characters per run
LC = average number of Kanji character per run
LK = average number of Katakana character per run
CP = ratio of tooten (comma) to kuten (period)
Run = a continuous string of the same type of character

Deck visualizations
---------------------
Use the relative deck size as an icon -- a stack of cards, that show depth.
