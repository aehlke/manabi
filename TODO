ajax error handling

change deck for fact in fact editor

BUGS:
-delete facts associated with deck when deleting deck

clear card edit view when deleting a card

fail the last card. it will ask again, but won't hide the answer first.

theres a bug in this scenario: fail a card, request more cards from server before the card failure request is returned by the server.
the failed card will be excluded. have to think about how to prevent this one.
failed cards at end isn't consistent yet. try this: 3 cards left, all failed. grade 2 as hard. last failed 
card won't show.

don't show the same card multiple times after itself, ever. this sometimes happens with failed cards
i think.

fieldcontent.contents uniqueness should be enforced on a per-deck level, so that downloading decks is fine,
but creating a new non-unique card currently is not allowed - it should be allowed as long as it is unique 
for that specific deck it's being inserted into, i guess.

double import (see: sys.modules) http://pastebin.com/m30b7c28f 676 721


IDEAS:
mark a word 'completely learned and memorized!' when interval reaches 120 - age of user. Haha!
'view newly learned cards from this session' after session ends

only constrain unique deck names when creating a new deck, not downloading (for now - makes things easier)
