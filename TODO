manabi notes


SUPER CRITICAL BUGS:
can't add cards to a fact via Fact Add dialog! see error log, views.py:369 too

---------------------
TODO:
---------------------
space cards from same fact.
give a negative bonus when reviewing cards from the same fact without waiting for delay.

bonus for late review

allow selecting multiple facts

make field requirements dependent on which cards are to be generated

limit the number of '2 cards created for...' messages shown

truncate deck names for Add Facts dialog (cut out the middle since the end often has something like the chapter)

somehow shorten the card templates button in Add Facts if it gets too long

tags (should have stuff like kaiwa 1 for textbook facts)

don't allow word wrapping in fact editor grid

---------------------
TODO (low priority):
---------------------
increase font size for fact add fields, especially japanese ones

resend grade xhrposts upon error. warn user when offline too

ajax error handling

change deck for fact in fact editor

disable controls after each review

confirm close of add flashcard dialog if there is unsaved input

show a tooltip for fact field input when creating a new fact. inside, list any matching facts from one's own 
account, or from any shared decks (or from anyone else's account? with permissions..). upon clicking one, 
fill in the current fact dialog with that card (but warn user that they'll lose what they're writing now? or 
somehow save it.. allow 'back') and change the 'Add' button to say 'Update' if it's from user's existing 
cards. Or, open a second add fact dialog, maybe. (How to implement 'back'?)

---------------------
BUGS:
---------------------
restart fcgi gracefully!

facts submitted twice (or at least twiced logged) when using cmd-enter to submit add fact dialog

don't allow deleting last deck!

'card' admin shows bad unicode data - crashes admin interface

delete facts associated with deck when deleting deck

clear card edit view when deleting a card

-(?) theres a bug in this scenario: fail a card, request more cards from server before the card failure request is returned by the server.
the failed card will be excluded. have to think about how to prevent this one.
failed cards at end isn't consistent yet. try this: 3 cards left, all failed. grade 2 as hard. last failed 
card won't show.

fieldcontent.contents uniqueness should be enforced on a per-deck level, so that downloading decks is fine,
but creating a new non-unique card currently is not allowed - it should be allowed as long as it is unique 
for that specific deck it's being inserted into, i guess.

double import (see: sys.modules) http://pastebin.com/m30b7c28f 676 721

grid column alignment is off when updating a fact (changed the cards..)

----------------------
IDEAS:
----------------------
mark a word 'completely learned and memorized!' when interval reaches 120 - age of user. Haha!
'view newly learned cards from this session' after session ends

only constrain unique deck names when creating a new deck, not downloading (for now - makes things easier)

---------------------
SOMEDAY TODO:
---------------------
only show the loader spinner on the inside of a dialog, not including its titlepane

mincho vs gothic fonts for kanji, maybe on mouse hover or something (useful for learning)

inflection (like in Genki)



---------------------
Stuff to consider:
---------------------
should 'reading' be left blank when the expression has no kanji?

a database of known textbooks. special fields that only activate per textbook (or special models)
intermediate japanese textbook cards could use bunpou note references - what else?

field for word type - verb, na-adj, etc
