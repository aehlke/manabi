manabi notes


~new stuff~
-----------
gotta truncate deck names when displayed
when not signed in, bugs! (click title)
resize grid when window is resized!!! otherwise scrollbars get lost

make card template widget demand at least 1 checkmark at all times (really?)

should all those connects be disconnected somehow?

try using select_related to speed up the orm

SUPER CRITICAL BUGS:
--------------------
none for now


---------------------
TODO:
---------------------
card 5176 has a no good fact

update fact grid when a card is added

-disable form submission buttons while they're being processed, after clicked - 

space cards from same fact.
give a negative bonus when reviewing cards from the same fact without waiting for delay.

bonus for late review

allow selecting multiple facts

make field requirements dependent on which cards are to be generated

truncate deck names for Add Facts dialog (cut out the middle since the end often has something like the chapter)

tags (should have stuff like kaiwa 1 for textbook facts)

take the fact creation datetime into account when scheduling reviews (but not including downloaded shared deck facts)

see my 'sansou / mountain cottage card [=yama no bessou]' - kanji from that is useless since it's given.
so, we need a separate field for synonym!

furigana support

---------------------
TODO (low priority):
---------------------
use named URLs

review only certain decks or certain tags

select last-used deck in fact add dialog (and last used model, cards etc) - (per session or not?)

don't allow word wrapping in fact editor grid

increase font size for fact add fields, especially japanese ones

resend grade xhrposts upon error. warn user when offline too

ajax error handling

change deck for fact in fact editor

disable controls after each review

confirm close of add flashcard dialog if there is unsaved input

show a tooltip for fact field input when creating a new fact. inside, list any matching facts from one's own 
account, or from any shared decks (or from anyone else's account? with permissions..). upon clicking one, 
fill in the current fact dialog with that card (but warn user that they'll lose what they're writing now? or 
somehow save it.. allow 'back') and change the 'Add' button to say 'Update' if it's from user's existing 
cards. Or, open a second add fact dialog, maybe. (How to implement 'back'?)

sort facts with case insensitivity

---------------------
BUGS:
---------------------
cmd-enter might break when the cards dropdown is open

for some reason the fact editor is showing 2 identical fact types, sometimes

grid selection moves around when refreshing after updating fact

restart fcgi gracefully!

deselect fact from grid after updating it (maybe? confusing since the form disappears but it's still selected)

new card count should be cleared each time the review dialog is opened - it has the old value for a second

don't allow deleting last deck!

delete facts associated with deck when deleting deck

clear card edit view when deleting a card

-(?) theres a bug in this scenario: fail a card, request more cards from server before the card failure request is returned by the server.
the failed card will be excluded. have to think about how to prevent this one.
failed cards at end isn't consistent yet. try this: 3 cards left, all failed. grade 2 as hard. last failed 
card won't show.

fieldcontent.contents uniqueness should be enforced on a per-deck level, so that downloading decks is fine,
but creating a new non-unique card currently is not allowed - it should be allowed as long as it is unique 
for that specific deck it's being inserted into, i guess.

grid column alignment is off when updating a fact (changed the cards..)

----------------------
IDEAS:
----------------------
mark a word 'completely learned and memorized!' when interval reaches 120 - age of user. Haha!
'view newly learned cards from this session' after session ends

only constrain unique deck names when creating a new deck, not downloading (for now - makes things easier)

---------------------
SOMEDAY TODO:
---------------------
only show the loader spinner on the inside of a dialog, not including its titlepane

mincho vs gothic fonts for kanji, maybe on mouse hover or something (useful for learning)

inflection (like in Genki)



---------------------
Stuff to consider:
---------------------
should 'reading' be left blank when the expression has no kanji?

a database of known textbooks. special fields that only activate per textbook (or special models)
intermediate japanese textbook cards could use bunpou note references - what else?

field for word type - verb, na-adj, etc


---------------------
Scheduling ideas:
---------------------
scenario: reviewing a card that was failed just a few minutes ago.
the meaning of 'too easy' for example really changes here. With new cards, the grades show how well you already 
knew the card. But for a recently failed card, 'too easy' is kind of expected
